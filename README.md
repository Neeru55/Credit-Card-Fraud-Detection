# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project implements fraud detection using Decision Trees and XGBoost. It involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and AUC-ROC metrics. ROC curves are plotted to compare model performance, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in financial security.
